## erisdb-js

`erisdb-js` is a javascript API for [erisdb-tendermint](https://github.com/eris-ltd/erisdb).

**NOTE: Right now it uses tendermint directly, as it has not yet been fully integrated with GenDoug.**

### Installation and usage

npm install eris-db

The main class is `ErisDb`. A standard `ErisDB` instance is created like this:

```
var edbFactory = require('erisdb');

var edb = edbFactory.createInstance("ws://localhost:1337/rpc");

edb.start(callback);

```

The parameters for `createInstance` is the server endpoint as a string, and whether or not to use websockets (false or no value means it will use http).

### API Reference

There are bindings for all the RPC methods.

TODO link to web-api pages and jsdoc

### Tests

Tests are done using `mocha`. At this point, there is only integration tests which requires a running erisdb server. These will be moved into a separate repo and replaced with other tests before 1.0.

### Documentation

Docs can be generated by using the scripts `doc.sh` or `devDoc.sh`; the latter will include private fields and functions.

### Browser

This library will be possible to run from a web-browser.
